# Annotations Action

GitHub action for creating annotations from JSON file

## Note

This repository uses npm packages from `@attest` scope on github; we are working hard to open source these packages.

## ðŸ”¥ Getting started

Make sure you have a `~/.npmrc` file setup with a [github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (read packages scope) to authenticate with the Github package registry for [fe-tools](https://github.com/Attest/fe-tools/packages)

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={githubtoken}
@attest:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

Then install with

```
yarn
```
